# eko-inventory
This is a QBCore Inventory Developed off of ax-inventory
I was given permission to rename this inventory and continue its development.

Since this has been asked many times. Remove -main on the end of the file name prior to starting the script. 

This inventory is modeled off of both aj-inventory and qb-inventory.

This resources is still heavily in-development and it is not advised to use this on production servers. 
Please let me know if you find any issues with the inventory: TheLostEcho#0001
